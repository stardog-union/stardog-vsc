# sparql synxtax

For now this is just a language colorizer powered by a TextMate SPARQL grammar definition -> `syntaxes/sparql.tmLanguage`

It's not hosted in VSCode's extension library yet, so to install it:

```
cp path/to/sparql/root $HOME/.vscode/extensions
```

Make sure you have VSCode installed first!  Once you've copied this directory to `.vscode/extensions`, either restart VSCode or reload the window (`CMD+SHIFT+P`, then type `reload` - you'll see the appropriate option)

Open a `.sparql` or `.rq` file, et voila!
